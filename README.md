# hackisumedicaltattoo

Android application to read medical information that is encoded in a tattoo.

The motivation behind this project is to create a medical tatoo containing information that could
potentially help bystanders and first responders in the event that a person is found in need of
medical attention. The tattoo should also be simple enough that it can easily be memorized by
those in the medial field. 

The application uses openCV to detect circles that are tattood on a person's skin compared the
sampled image to list of references to determine what conditions that person has.
